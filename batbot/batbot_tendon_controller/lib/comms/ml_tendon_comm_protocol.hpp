/**
 * @brief Enum defining opcodes for motor tendon control
 * 
 * The protocol parses data packets (see the data packet structure) and performs the following functions as follows:
 * 
 * READ_STATUS: Reads the status of the motor specified by motor ID. If motor ID is given to be 0xFF, then READ_STATUS
 * will perform a multiple read command. In this case you must pass the ID of each motor whose status you want to read.
 * The order of the IDs does not matter.
 * 
 * For instance if you would like to read the status of motors 2, 4, 6, the params would be:
 * 
 * [ 0x02 ][ 0x04 ][ 0x06 ]
 *               
 * READ_ANGLE: Reads the angle of the motor specified my motor ID. If the specified ID is 0xFF, then READ_ANGLE
 * will perform a multiple read command. You must pass the ID of each motor whose angle you want to read. The 
 * order of the IDs does not matter.
 *  
 * For instance if you would like to read the angles of motors 2, 4, 6, the params would be:
 * 
 * [ 0x02 ][ 0x04 ][ 0x06 ]
 * 
 * WRITE_ANGLE: Writes a goal angle (signed 16-bit integer) to the motor specifed by motor ID. This function requires 2 parameters in 
 * the following order:
 * 
 * Param 1                  Param 2
 * [ GOAL ANGLE BYTES HIGH ][ GOAL ANGLE BYTES LOW ]
 * 
 * If the specified ID is 0xFE, then the request becomes a multiple write command. You must pass as a parameter the ID of each
 * motor you want to write immediately followed by the goal angle high and low bytes. The order of motor IDs does not matter,
 * however, the goal angle high and low bytes must immediately follow their corresponding motor ID.
 * 
 * For instance, if you would like to write motor 2 to 0 degrees and motor 4 to 5 degrees, the params would be:
 * 
 * Motor ID 1  Goal Angle 1 High   Goal Angle 1 Low    Motor ID 2  Goal Angle 2 High   Goal Angle 2 Low
 * [   0x02   ][       0x00       ][       0x00       ][   0x04   ][       0x00       ][       0x00       ]
 * 
 * [ MOTOR ID 1 ][ MOTOR ID 1 GOAL ANGLE HIGH BYTES ][ MOTOR ID 2 GOAL ANGLE HIGH BYTES ]
 * 
 * For each motor you wish to write.
 * 
 * WRITE_PID: Writes the PID parameters (signed 16-bit integers) to the motor specifed by motor ID. This function requires 6 parameters in 
 * the following order:
 * 
 * [ P BYTES HIGH ][ P BYTES LOW ][ I BYTES HIGH ][ I BYTES LOW ][ D BYTES HIGH ][ D BYTES LOW ]
 * 
 * This function does not support multiple write operations.
 * 
 * *Note*: Look into the possibility of multiple write operations. Only problem is that the messages can get very long. Need to test if this 
 * causes any significant input lag.

/**
 * @brief Struct to define tendon control data packet
 * 
 * This struct defines the data packets defined by the tendon control communication protocol
 * The structure of a packet is as follows:
 * 
 * [ HEADER 1 ][ HEADER 2 ][ LENGTH ][ MOTOR ID ][ OPCODE ][ PARAMS ][ CRC HIGH ][ CRC LOW ]
 * 
 * HEADER 1+2: Used as a packet delimiter to signifify the start of a new packet. Always the bytes 0xFF 0x00.
 * LENGTH: 8-bit integer used to specify the length of the packet. The header and length fields
 *          are not taken into account when calculating length, so the length is calculated as
 *          4 + number of params (4 comes from opcode, params, and both CRC fields).
 * MOTOR ID: The id of the motor to read/write. Motors are assumed to be 1 indexed, so 0x00
 *            is used to read/write all motors.
 * OPCODE: 8-bit integer used to command the tendon controller to perform a certain action
 *          (e.g. read/write angles, write PID, etc.)
 * PARAMS: An array of 8-bit integers. Used as the "arguments" for the opcode.
 * CRC HIGH+LOW: Together, form a a 16-bit CRC used for checking data corruption
 * 
 * NOTE: When modifying this struct, keep field order and byte-alignment in mind.
 * 
 * This data structure takes advantage of byte-alignment, allowing for direct
 * casting of the input buffer directly to this object. This also allows for
 * accessing fields using either array or struct accessors.
